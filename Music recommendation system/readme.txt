Music Recommendation System
Overview
This project is a music recommendation system built to explore machine learning techniques for recommending songs based on user preferences. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the creation of a recommendation function using similarity metrics.

About the Dataset
The dataset includes information about various songs with the following columns:

Song-Name: The title of the song.
Album/Movie: The album or movie from which the song originates.
Singer/Artists: The performer(s) of the song.
Genre: The genre or category of the music.
User-Rating: Ratings given by users on a scale (e.g., 1-5).
Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Install Required Libraries
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Prepare the Dataset
Place your dataset (ex.csv) in the specified directory (A:\in\training\music recomendation system\).

Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps include:

Removing missing values and duplicates.
Extracting and formatting relevant data.
Creating a 'tags' column by combining song attributes for similarity analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA involves:

Distribution of User Ratings: Visualizing the distribution of user ratings using a histogram.
Most Common Genres: Counting and plotting the frequency of each genre.
Most Rated Artists: Identifying and plotting the top 10 most rated artists.
Building the Similarity Matrix
The similarity matrix is built using:

CountVectorizer: To convert text data into numerical vectors.
Cosine Similarity: To measure similarity between songs based on their tags.
Recommendation Function
A recommendation function suggests similar songs based on a given song title using the precomputed similarity matrix.

Example Usage
python
Copy code
recommend('Proper Patola')
This will print out the titles of the top 5 recommended songs similar to "Proper Patola".
